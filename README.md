# Portfolio Page

## Context
This was an initial project completed to practice basic front-end technologies (e.g., HTML, CSS) in the creation of a simple business card web page for myself.

## How to Use
1. Visit and view the site here: https://thomaslesperance.github.io/portfolio-page/

## Features
This code comprises only a single web page and does not use any advanced coding elements such as Flexbox or DOM manipulation. What is displayed was created solely with pure HTML and CSS. The page is currently displayed on GitHub pages via the link above.

## Technologies and Tools
-- HTML/ CSS

## Conclusion
Future goals for this page will be to enhance the view experience wtih more advanced coding elements such as React and Boostrap. It might potentially be a single entry portal into a consolidated display of other completed coding projects for quick demonstration.
